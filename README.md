# Voices
 An **Android application** which performs **Speech to Text**.
# App Description
• The application fetches Speech as input from user.

• Recognizes the input speech stream.

• Converts the speech into text.

• Identifies if the phrase is present in the dictionary or not.

• Displays the frequency – i.e. the number of times a phrase is spoken.

# User Interface
The App will perform the following functionalities:

• All words in the dictionary are displayed to the user.

• User shall tap on a button and begin to speak.

• If an exact match for the spoken phrase is available in the
dictionary, highlight the phrase.
